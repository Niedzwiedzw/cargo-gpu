# SPIR-V Builder CLI Template

> [!CAUTION]
> This may look like a typical crate, but it is in fact more like a crate _template_.
> It is intended to be primarily called by `cargo gpu`, which has these files embedded
> into its binary and so can copy and edit them to automatically compile end-user
> shaders.
